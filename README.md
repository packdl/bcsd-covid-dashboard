Scraped data from BCSD covid dashboard to create my own reports
You can find the collected data [here](output/data.csv) and a cleansed data file [here](output/cleansed_data.csv) that moves all data into a common format. 

## Current report
I keep an interactive notebook, but a static report is available [here](output/report.ipynb)
